## Persona Based SocialBot

The aim of this project is to develop a chat bot which can exhibit a pre-defined persona and can
carry out non-goal oriented chit chat conversations. Such conversations are expected to be more
engaging as the chat bot will know have a proper context about how to carry out a conversation.
For this purpose, we have used the Parl AI persona chat dataset from the parl AI library. The
attempted model achieves a best perplexity score of 15 and a 0.006 on BLEU.
